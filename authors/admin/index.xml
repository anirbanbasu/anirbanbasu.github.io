      <description>With more than a decade of research experience within both academia and industry, I have co-authored 75+ research papers and submitted about 20 co-authored Japanese patent applications. My research is based on a user-centric view of privacy; and computational trust as an information security paradigm in an increasingly knowledge-based connected world. The areas of research that interest me include, but are not limited to: computational trust systems, privacy and risk, privacy preserving data mining, artificial intelligence and ethics, cybersecurity, distributed consensus, and the Internet of Things.</description>
