      <description>Summary With more than a decade of research experience within both academia and industry, I have co-authored 70+ research papers and submitted about 20 co-authored Japanese patent applications. My research is based on a user-centric view of privacy; and computational trust as an information security paradigm in an increasingly knowledge-based connected world. I like building things to solve real-world problems.
Outside research and problem solving, I am keen on photography, videography and the associated travels.</description>
