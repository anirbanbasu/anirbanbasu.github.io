      <description>With more than a decade of research experience within both academia and industry, I have co-authored 70+ research papers and 25+ Japanese patents. My publications have been cited more than 1,200 times setting my overall h-index to 19 (source: Google Scholar). My research is based on a user-centric view of privacy; and computational trust as an information security paradigm in an increasingly knowledge-based connected world. The areas of research that interest me include, but are not limited to: computational trust systems, distributed consensus, privacy and risk, privacy preserving data mining, AI safety and causal models.</description>
