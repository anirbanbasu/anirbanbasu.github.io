      <description>With more than a decade of research experience within both academia and industry, I have co-authored 70+ research papers and 25+ Japanese patents. My publications have been cited more than 1,500 times setting my overall h-index to over 20 (source: Google Scholar). My current research is based on a user-empowering view of computational trust in human-machine interactions; and the role of computational trust in security and privacy. The areas of research that interest me include, but are not limited to: computational trust systems, AI security, AI ethics and causal modelling, distributed consensus, privacy and risk, and privacy preserving data mining.</description>
