<p>I am a computer science researcher by profession. Find out more about my work and publications on my <a href="http://www.anirbanbasu.com">profile website</a>.</p>

<p>Photography has been one of my hobbies for many years. I have always taken interest in my father&rsquo;s Nikon 35mm SLR film camera since my childhood, although mainly from the perspective of how it works. In my late teens, my parents presented me with a fixed focus compact film camera. Although basic, it got me interested in taking photos. Shortly after I moved to the UK, I switched to digital because of the complexities and costs of developing film. My interest in both photography (as well as videography) and cameras spiked a great deal after I moved to Japan, which offers an abundance of interesting subjects from the details of city life to exquisite natural beauties; and there is never a shortage of the cutting edge of digital photography equipment.</p>

Every moment is unique! In my constant tussle with time, I attempt to capture moments from the extraordinary to the most mundane of things that I see around me. My favourite subjects include, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>People, when they are not posing for the camera.</li>
<li>Nature, landscape, and especially Mt. Fuji.</li>
<li>Food that looks good and also tastes good.</li>
<li>Small, oft-overlooked things, e.g., fallen cherry blossom petals or autumn leaves.</li>
<li>Trains, the Japanese Shinkansen, in particular.</li>
<li>City life, a lot of Tokyo.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some things are better captured as videos than photographs, e.g., some cultural events, or a short travel; or something more unnoticed such as, autumn leaves swept up in the wind, or the flowing water in a mountain stream.</p>

<p>Generally, I post videos of life in Japan on my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/xtremebytes">YouTube channel</a>. There is some focus on trains, and the high-speed train in particular, which is one of my favourite subjects. In my videos, I try to portray life with some attention to details without providing any voice-over commentary so that the viewer is encouraged to hear incidental sounds and feel the atmosphere. I also have some videos relating to my travels outside Japan.</p>

<p>Apart from photography and videography, I draw too, when I get the time. Primarily, these are sketches on paper and sometimes on the iPad. I also help develop websites and design brochures for people and organisations.</p>
