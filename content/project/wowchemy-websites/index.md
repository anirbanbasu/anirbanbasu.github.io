[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) fast static website generator that renders a static website based on configuration, internationalisation bundles, layout templates, static files, and content written in Markdown (and other languages). I discovered Hugo some years back when I decided to migrate my website from Google sites (the old website maybe [still around](http://abasu.xtremebytes.com/) but not updated any further).

At the time of changing from Google sites, I found the Academic theme (now part of [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/)) sufficient for what I needed. Over time, I (hope I) have improved my website publishing pipeline with a combination of the [content hosted on Github](https://github.com/anirbanbasu/anirbanbasu.github.io) utilising the Wowchemy Academic theme, workflows to publish the website when I push changes to the main branch or experimental branches. The main website is available at https://www.anirbanbasu.com while the experimental stuff maybe visible at https://anirbanbasu.netlify.app.

In addition, I am also creating and maintaining other websites, e.g., that of my friend, [Michael Intal Magcamit](https://www.magcamit.com).

If necessary, I plan to contribute, when I can, to [Wowchemy](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) and [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo).
