        #### Name
        <div style='text-align: justify'>
        <p>
        My name Anirban is a Bengali name ("‡¶Ö‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶£", if you have Bengali fonts to see that), which means a light that shines forever. In Bengali, it sounds a bit like: aw-nee-r-baan. However, as Bengali is not a language with strict intonations, many variations of the pronunciation by non-Bengali speakers still make sense (somewhat!). In Japanese (Katakana), it is written as „Éê„Çπ„ÄÄ„Ç™„Éã„Éê„É≥ (note that the family name is written first) and pronounced (in Romanization) ba-su o-ni-ba-n.
        </p>
