 abstract = {Cultural institutions, such as museums are particularly interested in making their collections accessible to people with physical disabilities. New technologies, such as Web3D and augmented reality (AR) can aid museums to respond to this challenge by building virtual museums accessible over the Internet or through kiosks located in accessible places within the museum. In this paper, we propose a prototype user-friendly visualisation interface that uses Web3D and AR techniques to visualise cultural heritage artefacts for virtual museum exhibitions. User interactions within the virtual museum are performed in an effective way with the help of assistive technology, so that users can feel completely related with the virtual museum artefacts and so benefit in terms of education and entertainment.},
