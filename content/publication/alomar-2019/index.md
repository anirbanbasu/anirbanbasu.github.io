abstract: Data in cloud has always been a point of attraction for the cyber attackers.
  Nowadays healthcare data in cloud has become their new interest. Attacks on these
  healthcare data can result in annihilating consequences for the healthcare organizations.
  Decentralization of these cloud data can minimize the effect of attacks. Storing
  and running computation on sensitive private healthcare data in cloud are possible
  by decentralization which is enabled by peer to peer (P2P) network. By leveraging
  the decentralized or distributed property, blockchain technology ensures the accountability
  and integrity. Different solutions have been proposed to control the effect of attacks
  using decentralized approach but these solutions somehow failed to ensure overall
  privacy of patient centric systems. In this paper, we present a patient centric
  healthcare data management system using blockchain technology as storage which helps
  to attain privacy. Cryptographic functions are used to encrypt patientâ€™s data and
  to ensure pseudonymity. We analyze the data processing procedures and also the cost
  effectiveness of the smart contracts used in our system.
