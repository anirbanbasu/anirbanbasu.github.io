abstract: 'Trust models have been used widely in the literature in a number of different
  contexts. We examine an emotive scenario where trust would be extremely useful:
  online dating. We explore the use of a semiring-based trust model with online dating
  in a social network. Introductions are facilitated by friend-of-a-friend connections
  in the network in a manner similar to some real world scenarios. We show how ethical
  and human factors, which are usually not considered, cause problems. We hope that
  as a result the trust community can work together to formulate new approaches to
  trust for emotive applications that accommodate ethical and human factors which
  are difficult to quantify.'
