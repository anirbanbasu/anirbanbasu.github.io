abstract: There are a number of P2P overlay simulators developed by various research
  groups for use by the P2P academic community, however many still opt to use their
  own custom-built simulator. Having surveyed the area of Peer-to-Peer simulators
  in previous work, we believe that this is due to the simulators lacking key functionality
  such as mechanisms to gather statistical data from simulation runs. The use of custom
  built simulators gives rise to a number of problems that include an increase in
  the difficulty to reproduce and validate results and comparison of similar simulated
  systems and their associated results. In this paper, we discuss the current situation
  with respect to simulation usage in P2P research and our work towards creating a
  new simulator that will meet the requirements of P2P researchers. It is our hope
  that this paper will give rise to further discussion and knowledge sharing among
  those of the P2P and simulation research communities, so that a simulator that meets
  the needs of the P2P community can be developed.
