abstract: In client-server interaction scenarios over a network the problem of unsolicited
  network transactions is often encountered. In this paper, we propose a reputation
  model based on the behavioural history of long-lived network client identities as
  a solution to this problem. The reputations of clients are shared between trusted
  servers anonymously through global reputation analysers. Shared global reputations
  and local reputations help servers to infer local opinions of clients and control
  service levels in attempts to reduce unsolicited network transactions.
