abstract: In the NÃ¤ive Bayes classification problem using a vertically partitioned
  dataset, the conventional scheme to preserve privacy of each partition uses a secure
  scalar product and is based on the assumption that the data is synchronised amongst
  common unique identities. In this paper, we attempt to discard this assumption in
  order to develop a more efficient and secure scheme to perform classification with
  minimal disclosure of private data. Our proposed scheme is based on the work by
  Vaidya and Clifton [1], which uses commutative encryption to perform secure set
  intersection so that the parties with access to the individual partitions have no
  knowledge of the intersection. The evaluations presented in this paper are based
  on experimental results, which show that our proposed protocol scales well with
  large sparse datasets.
