abstract: We report on designing augmented reality (AR) applications to support the
  practices of going shopping, using an accompanied shopping and reflection technique
  to assess the key points of engagement among shoppers and producers at a farmers'
  market. Our goal was to deploy innovative mobile technology in a low-tech context
  so that it supported everyday behaviour. The paper documents how a short research
  intervention was decisive in shaping the applications designed for the AR tool and
  explores how stories told as part of the market and in interview were used to help
  organise our insights.
