 abstract = {We report on designing augmented reality (AR) applications to support the practices of going shopping, using an accompanied shopping and reflection technique to assess the key points of engagement among shoppers and producers at a farmers' market. Our goal was to deploy innovative mobile technology in a low-tech context so that it supported everyday behaviour. The paper documents how a short research intervention was decisive in shaping the applications designed for the AR tool and explores how stories told as part of the market and in interview were used to help organise our insights.},
