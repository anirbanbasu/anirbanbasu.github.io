abstract: In the article, the authors present an educational application that allows
  users to interact with 3D Web content (Web3D) using virtual and augmented reality
  (AR). This enables an exploration of the potential benefits of Web3D and AR technologies
  in engineering education and learning. A lecturerâ€™s traditional delivery can be
  enriched by viewing multimedia content locally or over the Internet, as well as
  in a tabletop AR environment. The implemented framework is composed in an XML data
  repository, an XML-based communications server, and an XML-based client visualisation
  application. In this article, the authors illustrate the architecture by configuring
  it to deliver multimedia content related to the teaching of mechanical engineering.
  Four mechanical engineering themes (machines, vehicles, platonic solids and tools)
  are illustrated here to demonstrate the use of the system to support learning through
  Web3D.
