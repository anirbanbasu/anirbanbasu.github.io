 abstract = {Farmers' markets are the source of a rich and pleasurable consumption experience. In this chapter, we report on our attempts to support and augment these experiences through the deployment of pervasive advertising. We describe the ethnographic approach we used to delineate the areas of enjoyment and pleasure, how narratives are weaved around and through the stalls and their products, and how trust is formed and maintained between the stallholders and the customers. We show how this understanding can be applied in the design of supporting advertising applications. We then evaluate the applications using the same ethnographic approach, uncovering problems which would not have been visible with other evaluation techniques.},
