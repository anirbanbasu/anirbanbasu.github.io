abstract: Farmers' markets are the source of a rich and pleasurable consumption experience.
  In this chapter, we report on our attempts to support and augment these experiences
  through the deployment of pervasive advertising. We describe the ethnographic approach
  we used to delineate the areas of enjoyment and pleasure, how narratives are weaved
  around and through the stalls and their products, and how trust is formed and maintained
  between the stallholders and the customers. We show how this understanding can be
  applied in the design of supporting advertising applications. We then evaluate the
  applications using the same ethnographic approach, uncovering problems which would
  not have been visible with other evaluation techniques.
