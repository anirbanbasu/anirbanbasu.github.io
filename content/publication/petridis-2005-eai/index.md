abstract: "Traditional exhibitions in museums provide limited possibilities of interaction\
  \ between the visitor and their artefacts. Usually, interaction is confined to reading\
  \ labels with little information on the exhibits, shop booklets, and audio guided\
  \ tours. These forms of interaction provide minimal information, and do not respond\
  \ to a visitor's personalized information preferences. As a result, there is no\
  \ direct involvement between the visitor and the exhibit. This paper expands on\
  \ a presentation metaphor, the virtual museum, which through the use of technologies\
  \ such as Web/X3D, VR and AR offers to the visitor the possibility of exploring\
  \ a virtual museum, interacting with virtual exhibits in real-time and visualising\
  \ these exhibits in contexts such as 3D gallery spaces. We offer a `pot pouri' of\
  \ novel and cost effective interaction and visualisation techniques that can be\
  \ integrated into web based virtual museums. In our virtual museums, the exhibit\
  \ is a digital representation of the cultural artefact, represented in various multimedia\
  \ formats such as text, images, videos and 3D models/scenes that can be placed inside\
  \ virtual gallery spaces. Such spaces can be explored, interacted with, and visualised\
  \ on museum web pages using standard VRML browsers. The interactions provided within\
  \ our system allow a museum web visitor to: participate in education quizzes about\
  \ the exhibits; examine them from different perspectives in VR environments; `pick-up'\
  \ and freely observe the exhibits in indoor AR environments; and finally interact\
  \ with an artefacts replica through a safe multimodal interface."
