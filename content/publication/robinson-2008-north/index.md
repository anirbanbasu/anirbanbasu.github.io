abstract: Facilitating navigation through commercial spaces by third party systems
  is a likely step in pervasive computing. For these applications to fully engage
  people they must build trust relationships in a natural manner. We hypothesize that
  the use of an explicit trust model in the design of the application would improve
  the rate at which trust is generated. To investigate this hypothesis, we have taken
  as a case study the design of a shopping guide for a local trading association.We
  have created an explicit trust model and incorporated this into our design.We have
  evaluated both our model and our application. The results of this confirmed our
  hypothesis and provided additional insight into how to model trust in the design
  of applications.
