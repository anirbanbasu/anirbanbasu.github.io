abstract: This paper describes ARCOLite, our low cost XML based client-server architecture
  for building and presenting digital heritage content in virtual museums. Our system
  includes components for creation and refinement of virtual artefacts including virtual
  reconstruction of buildings; XML content management, XML technologies for content
  repositories and presentation; and content visualisation using Web3D, virtual and
  augmented reality.
