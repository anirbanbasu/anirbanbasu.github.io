abstract: This paper presents a low cost architecture that extensively uses XML technologies
  to present generic digital content using the web and augmented reality. We describe
  our client-server architecture with particular emphasis on unique XML schemas that
  are used to design a generic XML repository and illustrate its use with two different
  application scenarios. Our solution allows management through XML and publication
  to a visualisation client supporting both virtual and augmented reality integrated
  with standard web browsing. Two application scenarios have been developed to illustrate
  the effectiveness of the system.
