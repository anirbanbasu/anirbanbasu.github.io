 abstract = {This paper presents a low cost architecture that extensively uses XML technologies to present generic digital content using the web and augmented reality. We describe our client-server architecture with particular emphasis on unique XML schemas that are used to design a generic XML repository and illustrate its use with two different application scenarios. Our solution allows management through XML and publication to a visualisation client supporting both virtual and augmented reality integrated with standard web browsing. Two application scenarios have been developed to illustrate the effectiveness of the system.},
