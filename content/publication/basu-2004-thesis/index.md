abstract: ARCO â€“ Augmented Representation of Cultural Objects (http://www.arco-web.org/)
  is a EU IST Framework V funded research project aimed at providing museums with
  useful technologies for digitising, managing and presenting virtual museum artefacts
  in virtual cultural environments. ARCOLite is a derivative of ARCO focused on small
  and medium scale museums, reducing the total cost of ownership by eliminating expensive
  Oracle database and patented X-VRML technology. ARCOLite is self-sufficient and
  can communicate with external digital culture systems. This final year project (A
  visualisation system for viewing museum artefacts) focuses on certain areas of the
  ARCOLite system. This report presents the overall concepts of the ARCOLite system
  and discusses in details the design and implementation of the underlying client-server
  architecture that forms the heart of ARCOLite by eliminating the equivalent Oracle
  and X-VRML architecture in ARCO. This report also describes the connectivity between
  an augmented reality client and the exhibition server.
