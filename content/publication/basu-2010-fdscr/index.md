abstract: Due to the open nature of the Internet, the abuse of the provided services
  has become widespread. Recent research has been conducted on behavioural profiling
  and reputations, mostly at the network level, to aid detection of malicious clients.
  We build on this research and propose a novel generalised framework for developing
  and globally sharing client reputations formed from behavioural histories. Promising
  initial simulations show a high level of success of our framework.
