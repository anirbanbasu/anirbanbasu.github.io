 abstract = {Due to the open nature of the Internet, the abuse of the provided services has become widespread. Recent research has been conducted on behavioural profiling and reputations, mostly at the network level, to aid detection of malicious clients. We build on this research and propose a novel generalised framework for developing and globally sharing client reputations formed from behavioural histories. Promising initial simulations show a high level of success of our framework.},
