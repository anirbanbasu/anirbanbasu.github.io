abstract: Farmers' markets are the source of a rich and pleasurable consumption experience.
  In this paper, we explored how we could support and augment these experiences through
  the deployment of a pervasive computing application. We describe the ethnographic
  approach we used to delineate the areas of enjoyment and pleasure, how narratives
  are weaved around and through the stalls and their products, and how trust is formed
  and maintained between the stallholders and the customers. We show how this understanding
  can be applied in the design of supporting applications. We then evaluate the applications
  using the same ethnographic approach, uncovering problems which would not have been
  visible with other evaluation techniques.
