abstract: In this paper, we discuss the current situation with respect to simulation
  usage in P2P research, testing the available P2P simulators against a proposed set
  of requirements, and surveying over 280 papers to discover what simulators are already
  being used. We found that no simulator currently meets all our requirements, and
  that simulation results are generally reported in the literature in a fashion that
  precludes any reproduction of results. We hope that this paper will give rise to
  further discussion and knowledge sharing among those of the P2P and network simulation
  research communities, so that a simulator that meets the needs of rigorous P2P research
  can be developed.
