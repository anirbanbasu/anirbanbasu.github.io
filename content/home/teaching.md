    Between 2004 and 2010, as an Associate Tutor at the University of Sussex, I have had teaching duties in the following courses in the (erstwhile) Department of Informatics and in the Department of Engineering and Design. Duties as an Associate Tutor included laboratory supervision, marking, course design and occasional lecturing at the post-graduate level. Sometimes some of the undergraduate courses were taken by Masters students too.
