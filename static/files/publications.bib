abstract = {Data in cloud has always been a point of attraction for the cyber attackers. Nowadays healthcare data in cloud has become their new interest. Attacks on these healthcare data can result in annihilating consequences for the healthcare organizations. Decentralization of these cloud data can minimize the effect of attacks. Storing and running computation on sensitive private healthcare data in cloud are possible by decentralization which is enabled by peer to peer (P2P) network. By leveraging the decentralized or distributed property, blockchain technology ensures the accountability and integrity. Different solutions have been proposed to control the effect of attacks using decentralized approach but these solutions somehow failed to ensure overall privacy of patient centric systems. In this paper, we present a patient centric healthcare data management system using blockchain technology as storage which helps to attain privacy. Cryptographic functions are used to encrypt patient’s data and to ensure pseudonymity. We analyze the data processing procedures and also the cost effectiveness of the smart contracts used in our system.}

  abstract={Rating-based collaborative filtering (CF) predicts the rating that a user will give to an item, derived from the ratings of other items given by other users. Such CF schemes utilise either user neighbourhoods (i.e. user-based CF) or item neighbourhoods (i.e. item-based CF). Lemire and MacLachlan [1] proposed three related schemes for an item-based CF with predictors of the form f(x) = x+b, hence the name ``slope one''. Slope One predictors have been shown to be accurate on large datasets. They also have several other desirable properties such as being updatable on the fly, efficient to compute, and work even with sparse input. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving item-based CF scheme through the use of an additively homomorphic public-key cryptosystem on the weighted Slope One predictor; and show its applicability on both horizontal and vertical partitions. We present an evaluation of our proposed scheme in terms of communication and computation complexity.},

In this paper, we attempt to discard this assumption in order to develop a more efficient and secure scheme to perform classification with minimal disclosure of private data. Our proposed scheme is based on the work by Vaidya and Clifton [1], which uses commutative encryption to perform secure set intersection so that the parties with access to the individual partitions have no knowledge of the intersection. The evaluations presented in this paper are based on experimental results, which show that our proposed protocol scales well with large sparse datasets.},

We show how ethical and human factors, which are usually not considered, cause problems.

  abstract={The open architecture of the Internet has enabled its massive growth and success by facilitating easy connectivity between hosts. At the same time, the Internet has also opened itself up to abuse, e.g. arising out of unsolicited communication, both intentional and unintentional. It remains an open question as to how best servers should protect themselves from malicious clients whilst offering good service to innocent clients. There has been research on behavioural profiling and reputation of clients, mostly at the network level and also for email as an application, to detect malicious clients. However, this area continues to pose open research challenges. This thesis is motivated by the need for a generalised framework capable of aiding efficient detection of malicious clients while being able to reward clients with behaviour profiles conforming to the acceptable use and other relevant policies. The main contribution of this thesis is a novel, generalised, context-aware, policy independent, privacy preserving framework for developing and sharing client reputation based on behavioural history. The framework, augmenting existing protocols, allows fitting in of policies at various stages, thus keeping itself open and flexible to implementation. Locally recorded behavioural history of clients with known identities are translated to client reputations, which are then shared globally. The reputations enable privacy for clients by not exposing the details of their behaviour during interactions with the servers. The local and globally shared reputations facilitate servers in selecting service levels, including restricting access to malicious clients. We present results and analyses of simulations, with synthetic data and some proposed example policies, of client-server interactions and of attacks on our model. Suggestions presented for possible future extensions are drawn from our experiences with simulation.},

In this paper, we propose a reputation model based on the behavioural history of long-lived network client identities as a solution to this problem. The reputations of clients are shared between trusted servers anonymously through global reputation analysers. Shared global reputations and local reputations help servers to infer local opinions of clients and control service levels in attempts to reduce unsolicited network transactions.},

To investigate this hypothesis, we have taken as a case study the design of a shopping guide for a local trading association.We have created an explicit trust model and incorporated this into our design.We have evaluated both our model and our application. The results of this confirmed our hypothesis and provided additional insight into how to model trust in the design of applications.},

Having surveyed the area of Peer-to-Peer simulators in previous work, we believe that this is due to the simulators lacking key functionality such as mechanisms to gather statistical data from simulation runs. The use of custom built simulators gives rise to a number of problems that include an increase in the difficulty to reproduce and validate results and comparison of similar simulated systems and their associated results.

In this paper, we focus on P2P simulators by surveying a number of P2P simulators with respect to important criteria when simulating a P2P system. Simulators are compared, usage experiences are given and limitations are discussed. The survey shows that while there are a plethora of simulators, there are many issues such as poor scalability, little or no documentation, steep learning curves, and system limitations that makes using these simulators a convoluted process.},

  abstract={Traditional exhibitions in museums provide limited possibilities of interaction between the visitor and their artefacts. Usually, interaction is confined to reading labels with little information on the exhibits, shop booklets, and audio guided tours. These forms of interaction provide minimal information, and do not respond to a visitor's personalized information preferences. As a result, there is no direct involvement between the visitor and the exhibit. This paper expands on a presentation metaphor, the virtual museum, which through the use of technologies such as Web/X3D, VR and AR offers to the visitor the possibility of exploring a virtual museum, interacting with virtual exhibits in real-time and visualising these exhibits in contexts such as 3D gallery spaces. We offer a `pot pouri' of novel and cost effective interaction and visualisation techniques that can be integrated into web based virtual museums. In our virtual museums, the exhibit is a digital representation of the cultural artefact, represented in various multimedia formats such as text, images, videos and 3D models/scenes that can be placed inside virtual gallery spaces. Such spaces can be explored, interacted with, and visualised on museum web pages using standard VRML browsers. The interactions provided within our system allow a museum web visitor to: participate in education quizzes about the exhibits; examine them from different perspectives in VR environments; `pick-up' and freely observe the exhibits in indoor AR environments; and finally interact with an artefacts replica through a safe multimodal interface.},

This final year project (A visualisation system for viewing museum artefacts) focuses on certain areas of the ARCOLite system. This report presents the overall concepts of the ARCOLite system and discusses in details the design and implementation of the underlying client-server architecture that forms the heart of ARCOLite by eliminating the equivalent Oracle and X-VRML architecture in ARCO.
